There are a few differences between the open-source version of Neurodesk and what's hosted on Nectar VDI:
1) There is no `/neurodesktop-storage` folder (the folder on the Desktop does not lead anywhere).
2) Files uploaded via drag and drop do not get stored on the desktop but in `/home/vdiuser/thinclient_drives/GUACFS`
