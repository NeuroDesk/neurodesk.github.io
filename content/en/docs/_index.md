# Neurodesktop

_Easiest way to run Neurodesk_

Neurodesktop is a compact Docker container with a browser-accessible environment for reproducible neuroimaging analysis. Only the required applications, already pre-installed, are downloaded from a public library (downloaded as containers).

# Neurocommand
_Recommended for Advanced users_

Installer that turns the host into a flexible, scalable, and easy to use data analysis environment for reproducible neuroimaging. Neurodesktop pre-installs Neurocommand in an Ubuntu docker container providing simple access to the powerful capabilities of Neurodesk.

Requires a Linux host machine, WSL for Windows, or a virtual machine.
