# Assumptions

- [ ] Your data is already in [BIDS format](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
- [ ] You plan to run fmriprep using Neurodesk
- [ ] You have a copy of the freesurfer license file (freesurfer.txt), that can be read from the file system using Neurodesk

# Steps

## Launch Neurodesk

From the launcher, click the Neurodesktop icon:

![launch_neurodesk](/tutorials/functional_imaging/fmriprep/launch_neurodesk.png 'launch_neurodesk') <!-- ![filename without extension](/tutorials/functional_imaging/subfolder_name/filename.png '[filename without extension')  -->

## Open fmriprep 

Now you're in Neurodesk, use the menus to first open the neurodesk options

![neurodesk_menu](/tutorials/functional_imaging/fmriprep/neurodesk_menu.png 'neurodesk_menu') <!-- ![filename without extension](/tutorials/functional_imaging/subfolder_name/filename.png '[filename without extension')  -->

and then select fMRIPrep. Note that the latest version will be the lowest on the dropdown list:

![open_fmriprep](/tutorials/functional_imaging/fmriprep/open_fmriprep.png 'open_fmriprep') <!-- ![filename without extension](/tutorials/functional_imaging/subfolder_name/filename.png '[filename without extension')  -->

This will open a terminal window where fMRIPrep is ready and waiting at your fingertips - woohoo!

![fmriprep_bash](/tutorials/functional_imaging/fmriprep/fmriprep_bash.png 'fmriprep_bash') <!-- ![filename without extension](/tutorials/functional_imaging/subfolder_name/filename.png '[filename without extension')  -->


## Setting up fmriprep command

You can now enter your fmriprep command straight into the command line in the newly opened terminal. Here is a quick guide to the command I have used with the options I have found most useful. Note that fMRIPrep requests the path to the freesurfer license file, which should be somewhere in your system for neurodesk to read - e.g. in 'neurodesktop-storage'.

```bash

export ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS=6 # specify the number of threads you want to use

fmriprep /path/to/your/data \ # this is the top level of your data folder
         /path/to/your/data/derivatives \ # where you want fmriprep output to be saved
         participant \ # this tells fmriprep to analyse at the participant level
         --fs-license-file /path/to/your/freesurfer.txt \ # where the freesurfer license file is
         --output-spaces T1w MNI152NLin2009cAsym fsaverage fsnative \ 
         --participant-label 01 \ # put what ever participant labels you want to analyse
         --nprocs 6 --mem 10000 \ # fmriprep can be greedy on the hpc, make sure it is not
         --skip_bids_validation \ # its normally fine to skip this but do make sure your data are BIDS enough
         -v # be verbal fmriprep, tell me what you are doing
```


Then hit return and fMRIPrep should now be merrily working away on your data :)

## Some common pitfalls I have learned from my mistakes (and sometimes from others)

1. If fmriprep hangs it could well be that you are out of disk space. Sometimes this is because fmriprep created a work directory in your home folder which is often limited on the HPC. Make sure fmriprep knows to use a work drectory in your scratch. you can specify this in the fmriprep command by using -w /path/to/the/work/directory/you/made

2. I learned the following from TomCat (@thomshaw92) - fMRIPrep can get confused between subjects when run in parallel. Parallelise with caution.

3. If running on a HPC, make sure to set the processor and memory limits, if not your job will get killed because it hogs all the resources.
