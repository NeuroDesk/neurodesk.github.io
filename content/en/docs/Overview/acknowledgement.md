# Acknowledgement

We are deeply grateful to all the individuals, institutions, and communities that support the Neurodesk project through their time, expertise, infrastructure, and resources.

## Cultural and Land Acknowledgement

**We acknowledge and honour the Traditional Custodians and Indigenous Peoples of all lands on which we live, work, and connect around the world.**  These lands have been, and continue to be, places of deep cultural, spiritual, and ancestral significance for their First Peoples.  We honour their resilience, knowledge, and contributions, and commit to respectful collaboration wherever our work reaches.  

This project is not tied to a single place, but we honour Indigenous sovereignty wherever our work reaches — including digital spaces. We invite all who engage with this work to reflect on their own relationship with the lands they are on and the histories they are a part of.
