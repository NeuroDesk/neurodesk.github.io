More details on MFCSC and this tutorial can be found in the following paper:

> Civier O, Sourty M, Calamante F (2023) MFCSC: Novel method to calculate mismatch between functional and structural brain connectomes, and its application for detecting hemispheric functional specialisations. Scientific Reports
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17213-z

In short, MFCSC calculates the mismatch between connectomes generated from different imaging modalities. It does it by normalising the connectomes to a common space calculated at group level, and taking into account the role of indirect connectivity in shaping the functional connectomes.


**TUTORIAL FOR CONNECTOMES FROM fMRI AND dMRI** 

1. Download the "input" folder from the OSF repository (https://osf.io/d7j9n/files/osfstorage)

2. Launch mfcsc from either "Neurodesk"-->"Diffusion Imaging --> mfsc --> mfcsc 1.1" or "Neurodesk"-->"Functional Imaging --> mfcsc --> mfcsc 1.1" in the start menu. 

3. Run the following command with **input** being the directory where the input data was downloaded to, and **outputdir** being the directory where the output should be written to:
```
    mfcsc input/FC_SC_list.txt input/FC input/SC outputdir
```

4. After MFCSC finishes running, the content of **outputdir** should be identical to the "output" folder in the OSF repository (https://osf.io/d7j9n/files/osfstorage)
   It contains connectomes that encode the mismatch between functional and structural connectivity (mFCSC) for every connection.


**TUTORIAL FOR CONNECTOMES FROM MEG AND dMRI** 

1. Use the MEG connectivity tutorial to generate functional connectomes from your MEG data using MNE tools on Neurodesk (Tutorial in progress: https://github.com/benmslade/neurodesk.github.io/blob/main/content/en/tutorials/electrophysiology/meg_connectivity.md)
   
2. Use the structul connectivity tutorial to generate structural connectomes from your dMRI data using MRtrix tools on Neurodesk (https://www.neurodesk.org/tutorials-examples/tutorials/structural_imaging/structuralconnectivity/)

3. Launch mfcsc from either "Neurodesk"-->"Diffusion Imaging --> mfsc --> mfcsc 1.1" or "Neurodesk"-->"Functional Imaging --> mfcsc --> mfcsc 1.1" in the start menu. 

4. Copy the MEG connectomes into input/MEG and the structural connectomes into input/SC

5. Create an input/MEG_SC_list.txt file that lists the pairing between MEG and structural connectomes

6. Run the following command with **input** being the directory where the input data was downloaded to, and **outputdir** being the directory where the output should be written to:
```
    mfcsc input/MEG_SC_list.txt input/MEG input/SC outputdir
```

7. After MFCSC finishes running, **outputdir** will  contains connectomes that encode the mismatch between MEG and structural connectivity (mFCSC) for every connection.
