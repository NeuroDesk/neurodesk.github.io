This tutorial documents how to use Connectome Workbench on NeuroDesk for visualizing the 7T HCP Retinotopy Dataset.

## Download data

1. First, make sure you register for the Human Connectome Project Open Access Data: https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-use-terms


2. Register to the BALSA database: https://balsa.wustl.edu/. 

![1_balsa](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/1_balsa.png '1_balsa')

3. Login and download the scene files containing the retinotopic maps available at: https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/9Zkk. 

![2_balsa](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/2_balsa.png '2_balsa')


These files include preprocessed collated data from 181 participants, including retinotopic, curvature, midthickness, and myelin maps. 

4. Finally, unzip the S1200_7T_Retinotopy_9Zkk.zip file.

## Visualizing scene files

Using Connectome Workbench, you can load ".scene" files and visualize all individuals' retinotopic maps. 
To do so, follow the next steps:

1. In the application menu, navigate to Neurodesk → functional imaging → connectomeworkbench → connectomeworkbench 1.5.0

![4_appmenu](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/4_appmenu.png '4_appmenu')

2. On the terminal shell that pops up, type in:

```bash
wb_view
```

![5_wbview](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/5_wbview.png '5_wbview')


3. Click on "Open Other"

![6_openother](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/6_openother.png '6_openother')

and search for a scene file

![7_scenefile](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/7_scenefile.png '7_scenefile')

in the path where your data is

![8_path](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/8_path.png '8_path')

Finally, select the desired file and open it:

![9_file](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/9_file.png '9_file')

4. On the 'Scenes' window that will pop up, select the first option.

![10_scene](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/10_scene.png '10_scene')

The default images are the average maps. 

![11_loadedscene](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/11_loadedscene.png '11_loadedscene')

5. To change the displayed images for an individual’s data instead, click on the first ticked dropdown menu 

![12_fileselection](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/12_fileselection.png '12_fileselection')

and select "S1200_7T_Retinotopy181.All.Fit1_PolarAngle_MSMALL.32k_fs_LR.dscalar.nii":

![13_polarAngleALL](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/13_polarAngleALL.png '13_polarAngleALL')

6. Now, you should be able to select specific maps from the dropdown menu on the right. For example, here we have the first individual polar angle map (top left):

![14_index1](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/14_index1.png '14_index1')

Now we have the fifth:

![14_index5](/tutorials/functional_imaging/connectomeWorkbench/14_index5.png '14_index5')

7. You can do the same for the other functional maps by navigating through the tabs at the top.
