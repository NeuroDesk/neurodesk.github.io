  Install neurodesktop on MacOS
---

## Quickstart
### 1. Install Docker or Podman
Install Docker from here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ 
Alternatively, Neurodesk also works with Podman, follow the Podman installation instructions provided at https://podman.io/docs/installation.

{{< alert color="warning" >}}
Docker for MacOS by default runs with 2GB Memory. For actual workloads, 4GB Memory minimum for docker is highly recommended. You need to adjust this: 
1. Open the Docker Desktop and Navigate to the Settings. Then navigate to the "Resources" section. 
2. Increase the Memory slider from 2.00 GB to 4.00 GB (or greater)
3. Increase Swap slider from 1GB to 2GB (or greater)

### 2. Run Neurodesktop
Use one of the following options to run Neurodesktop:

#### Option 1 (Recommended): Neurodesk-App
Instructions on installing and using the app: https://www.neurodesk.org/docs/getting-started/neurodesktop/neurodeskapp/

#### Option 2 (Advanced): Using Terminal
Create a local folder where the downloaded applications will be stored, e.g. ~/neurodesktop-storage 

1. Open a terminal, and type the following command to automatically download the neurodesktop container and run it

```shell
docker volume create neurodesk-home &&
docker run \
--shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --user=root --name neurodesktop \
-v ~/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage \
--mount source=neurodesk-home,target=/home/jovyan \
-e NB_UID="$(id -u)" -e NB_GID="$(id -g)" \
-p 8888:8888 -e NEURODESKTOP_VERSION={{< params/neurodesktop/jupyter_neurodesk_version >}} vnmd/neurodesktop:{{< params/neurodesktop/jupyter_neurodesk_version >}}
```

<!-- neurodesktop version found in neurodesk.github.io/data/neurodesktop.toml -->

If you get errors in neurodesktop then check if the ~/neurodesktop-storage directory is writable for all users. If it is not, run `chmod a+rwx ~/neurodesktop-storage`

2. Once neurodesktop is downloaded, leave the terminal open and check which server neurodesktop running on (Avoid pressing CTRL+C).

3. To access neurodesktop, open your web browser and navigate to one of the URLs shown in your terminal (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=your_unique_token`).

{{< alert color="warning" >}}
We recommend using Chrome over Firefox as it has an option to hide the Toolbar in full screen mode (go to the menu bar, click on View, and uncheck "Always Show Toolbar in Full Screen"). This allows for Neurodesktop to fully utilise the whole of your screen.

4. If prompted, press on "Desktop Auto-Resolution" under "ALL CONNECTIONS"

5. If it is the first time you use Neurodesktop, wait until the desktop appears (it may take a few seconds). Otherwise, it should appear instantaneously.

6. Neurodesk is ready to use! See the tutorials page for advice on how to use Neurodesk.     

{{< alert color="info" >}}
The browser can be closed anytime, and Neurodesktop will continue to run in the background. To reconnect to Neurodesktop, simply start over from step 3 above.

If you are using conda environments and you are installing packages or even new kernels, make sure to read this: https://www.neurodesk.org/tutorials-examples/tutorials/programming/conda/
{{< /alert >}}

## Deleting neurodesktop:
When done processing your data it is important to stop and remove the container - otherwise the next start or container update will give an error ("... The container name "/neurodesktop" is already in use...")

{{< alert title="Note" color="warning" >}}
Note that any data that were saved outside of /neurodesktop-storage would be lost. Please make sure to move all your data to that folder before deleting neurodesktop.
{{< /alert >}}

1. Click on the terminal from which you ran neurodesktop

2. Press control-C

3. Type:
```shell
docker stop neurodesktop
```
4. Type:
```shell
docker rm neurodesktop
```
