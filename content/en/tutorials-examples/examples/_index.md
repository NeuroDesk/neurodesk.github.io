<!-- [Install Neurodesk](https://www.neurodesk.org/docs/getting-started) and load these example notebooks

OR 

[Each Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/NeuroDesk/example-notebooks) in the repository is equipped with two buttons at the top: a Binder button and a Google Colab button. These buttons will allow you to interact with the notebooks in a cloud-based environment. The environment is pre-configured to support Neurodesk, so you can start experimenting with the notebooks right away without having to install any additional software or packages.

We provide a collection of example Jupyter notebooks to help you get started with Neurodesk and explore its capabilities. These notebooks cover various use cases and analyses.

You can run these examples directly in cloud environments like Binder or Google Colab, or locally after installing Neurodesk.
